**Tantra Yoga Workshop with Godfrey Devereux**,  Red Earth Centre Paris                                                                                                                                       **Saturday, May 21st: Making
love, the art of intimacy****** Making
love is not a skill, but a frame of mind. Becoming intimate with your
own presence as love is the only way to become able to be genuinely
intimate in love with others. This workshop will explore the
experiences, attitudes, and tools that can make genuine love a real
possibility, while remaining clothed. Using yoga posture praxis and
meditation godfrey will use refined and focussed instruction to
invite you to experience the deep, impersonal love at the heart of
human consciousness. Open to anyone interested in love and intimacy
regardless of experience in yoga. There will be no sexual activity
during this workshop, as we will be exploring the love upon which
satisfying sexual activity depends.       **Sunday, May 22nd: The
art of being pleasure****** Pleasure
is the natural expression of conscious awareness, and the subtle
heart of the human body. To become free from the destructive pursuit
of external and intense pleasures and the dependencies they generate,
we need some alternative. Dynamic Tantra uses movement, stillness,
intimate instruction and contact to access and release core sexual
energy so that the pleasure nature of the body reveals itself.
Then, perhaps, your experience of simply being alive can provide a
satisfaction more lasting and nourishing than that provided by
externally driven experiences, and you can find a genuine ease and
freedom in your sexual nature. There
will be no sexual activity during this workshop, as we will be
exploring the energies upon which satisfying sexual activity depends.
