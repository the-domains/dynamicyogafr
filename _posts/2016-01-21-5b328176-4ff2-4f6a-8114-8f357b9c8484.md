godfri says: "......if the mystical vision is true, and separateness an illusion projected onto unity by the creativity of mind, then you cannot be the author of the words you think and say, nor the source of the actions you perform. 

The human experience of individual objects and entities interacting through accidental and intentional actions is nothing more than an operational simulation through which consciousness navigates its biological constraints. In which case what has been had to be, what is must be, and what will be will be, regardless of your preferences, hopes, intentions and affirmations. You are not the one living your life, where you is biolographical identity. Your life, your identity is being lived through life by consciousness. But. no need for ego to panic in the face of its redundancy. rather, if there is any truth to this 'mystical' perspective, there is only good cause to celebrate. For that unity onto which multiplicity is projected, that singularity of consciousness fuelling all intelligence is what you are: endless within all endings, boundaryless within all boundaries, causeless within all causality, timeless for all time. never born, never dead."
